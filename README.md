# nlp_fake_news_classification
Classifying fake news and performing other NLP operations on the dataset. This is my solution to the practical task in the [Intro to NLP Course](https://github.com/l-newbould/introtonlp-365) by [Lauren Newbould](https://github.com/l-newbould) with some additional insights added.

## Requirements

Python version 3.12 or lower is required. This is because one of the dependencies is currently [not compatible](https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/issues/3601#issuecomment-2812768956) with the latest version of Python.
